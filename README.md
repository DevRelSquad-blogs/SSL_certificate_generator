# SSL & Encryption Project

Welcome to the SSL & Encryption project! This repository provides a detailed exploration of encryption techniques, SSL certificate creation, and secure HTTPS server testing on localhost. By working through this project, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of encryption and SSL, which are essential components of modern web security.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main folders:

- **encryption/**: Contains examples of symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods in JavaScript, illustrating fundamental concepts of cryptography.
- **ssl/**: Code to generate a self-signed SSL certificate using Node.js and `node-forge`, suitable for local testing.
- **test/**: A simple HTTPS server setup that uses the generated SSL certificate to enable secure connections on localhost.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Required to run JavaScript code on the server.
- **node-forge**: A JavaScript library for SSL certificate generation (install via `npm install node-forge`).

## Folder Details

### 1. Encryption Folder

This folder demonstrates two encryption approaches:

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, ideal for speed and simplicity.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a public and private key pair, which is more secure and commonly used for SSL.

For more details, refer to the [`README.md`](./encryption/README.md) in the `encryption` folder.

### 2. SSL Folder

This folder includes code for creating an SSL certificate, which is essential for enabling HTTPS. The certificate is self-signed and uses `node-forge` to generate public and private keys.

For more information, check out the [`README.md`](./ssl/README.md) in the `ssl` folder.

### 3. Test Folder

This folder sets up a basic HTTPS server using the SSL certificate and private key generated in the `ssl` folder. This server listens on localhost to simulate a secure, SSL-enabled environment.

For testing instructions, see the [`README.md`](./test/README.md) in the `test` folder.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ssl-encryption-project.git
    cd ssl-encryption-project
    ```

2. Install the required package:
    ```bash
    npm install node-forge
    ```

3. Follow the README instructions in each folder to explore encryption techniques, generate an SSL certificate, and test it on localhost.

## How It Works

This project demonstrates how encryption secures data and the role of SSL in establishing secure web connections. Here’s a high-level breakdown:

1. **Encryption**: Understand the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption is efficient but requires secure key sharing, while asymmetric encryption is widely used for SSL to protect data exchanges.

2. **SSL Certificate Generation**: Using `node-forge`, generate a self-signed SSL certificate, which includes creating and configuring the public-private key pair and setting the certificate’s validity.

3. **Local Testing**: Create a secure HTTPS server with Node.js to test the certificate. This helps visualize how HTTPS and SSL function together to secure communication.

## Conclusion

This project equips you with the basics of encryption and SSL and practical experience generating and using SSL certificates. In a real-world scenario, SSL certificates should be issued by trusted authorities, but the concepts here provide a foundational understanding of how SSL ensures data security.
